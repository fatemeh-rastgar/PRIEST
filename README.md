## Running the First Benchmark - Comparison on BARN Dataset

For the first benchmark, we conducted comparisons between several planners, including DWA, TEB, MPPI, log-MPPI, and our PRIEST method. Note that, for fair comparison, we have used 
the best possible implementations of all the baselines. 
To run these comparisons, follow these steps:

1- Launch PRIEST

      roslaunch priest clearpath_launch.launch
      rosrun priest planner_holonomic.py

2- Launch DWA/TEB Planner
  
        roslaunch compare clearpath_launch.launch
        roslaunch compare map_less_navigation.launch
        rosrun compare send_goal.py

Note that in the comparison/launch/map_less_navigation.launch file, you can choose whether to use the TEB planner or the DWA planner. To use the planner, use:

      <include file="$(find compare)/launch/move_base_teb.launch">
      
and to use the DWA planner:

      <include file="$(find compare)/launch/move_base.launch">
      
3- Launch MPPI/ log-MPPI:

To execute this benchmark, we have adapted the mppi-control package to be compatible with the Robotont Clearpath platform. The parameters remain the same as in the mppi-control package, with adjustments made to specific topics for compatibility with Robotont Clearpath. Please navigate to the "additional folder" in this repository. Copy the files and place them in corresponding directories within the mppi-control package. Afterward, run the following commands

      roslaunch priest clearpath_launch.launch
      roslaunch mppi-control control_stage_robotont.launch
      rosrun compare send_goal.py

Please change the value from "true" to "false" in the following command within the control_stage_robotont.launch file to select the log-MPPI or MPPI method: 

       <arg name="normal_dist" default="false" />
       

## Running the Planner on a Dynamic Environment

For this benchmark, we conducted comparisons between several planners, including baseline CEM, DWA, TEB, MPPI, log-MPPI, and our PRIEST method.
To run these comparisons, follow these steps:

1- Launch PRIEST:

      roslaunch priest nonhol_clearpath.launch
      rosrun priest planner_nonhol_dy.py

2- Launch CEM:

      roslaunch priest nonhol_clearpath.launch
      rosrun priest planner_cem_dynamic.py

3- Launch TEB/DWA Planner

       roslaunch compare clear_path_dynamic_2.launch 
       roslaunch compare map_less_navigation.launch
       rosrun compare send_obs_velocities.py
       rosrun compare send_goal.py

 Note that to run this benchmark, some changes are needed:
 
 a. Modification in the Gazebo simulation configuration found in the `jackal.gazebo` file within the `jackal_description` package by commenting out the plugin named `robot_groundtruth_sim` and adding the `jackal_controller` plugin 

      
            <gazebo>
                <plugin name="jackal_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_planar_move.so">
              <commandTopic>mppi/cmd_vel</commandTopic>
              <odometryTopic>ground_truth/odom</odometryTopic>
              <odometryFrame>odom</odometryFrame>
              <odometryRate>60.0</odometryRate>
              <robotBaseFrame>base_link</robotBaseFrame>
              <xyzOffsets>0 0 0</xyzOffsets>
              <rpyOffsets>0 0 0</rpyOffsets>
          </plugin>
            </gazebo>


 b. Adding the following lines to `move_base_teb.launch` / ` move_base.launch`

          <remap from='/cmd_vel' to='/mppi/cmd_vel'/>
          <remap from='/odom' to='/ground_truth/odom'/>

 c. Changing the `self.x_fin` and `self.y_fin` in `send_goal.py` to 0 and 15, respectively. 

4- Launch MPPI/ log-MPPI



      roslaunch compare clear_path_dynamic.launch 
      roslaunch mppi_control control_stage.launch
      rosrun compare send_obs_velocities.py
      rosrun compare send_goal.py

Please note that the following changes are required in send_goal.py 

- Subscriber topic: "/odom" to "/ground_truth/odom"
  
- goal.target_pose.header.frame_id should be "/map"

Additionally, for a fair comparison, we set the time horizon of MPPI and log-MPPI as 10s in `mppi_params_sim.yaml`.  

 We use laser scans to observe obstacles, so make sure to update the following files in the Jackal package:
 The link for the the yaml file is [link](https://github.com/fatemeh-rastgar/PRIEST/blob/main/compare/config/mppi_params_sim.yaml)

- costmap_common_params.yaml
